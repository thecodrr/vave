## Installation:

Install using `V`'s builtin `vpm` (you will need to import the module with: `import thecodrr.vave` with this method of installation):

```shell
v install thecodrr.vave
```

Install using `git`:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
git clone https://github.com/thecodrr/vave
```

Then in the wherever you want to use it:

```javascript
import thecodrr.vave //OR simply vave depending on how you installed
```

And that's it!

## Usage

_This library is in use in the [vspeech](https://github.com/thecodrr/vspeech) (V Bindings for DeepSpeech) utility that uses [Mozilla's DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) for Speech-to-Text. Do check that out as well._

### vave.open(`path`,`mode`)

Open a new WAV file in the specified mode. All mode supported by `C.fopen` are supported (e.g. `r`, `rb` etc.)

```javascript
mut wav := vave.open("/path/to/vave/file", "r") //open for reading
```

**NOTES:** The data is read into a `byteptr` and needs to be manually freed each and everytime or it will cause a huge memory leak. This library has been tested with `valgrind` and after freeing there is no other memory leak (if you find any, do report). I haven't implemented writing samples yet due to lack of time but its in my future plans.

### WavFile `struct`

`WavFile` struct is used for reading/writing samples and other metadata. It is returned by `vave.open`.

#### Read:

#### WavFile.read_raw()

Read all the samples from the file in their raw form.

#### WaveFile.read_samples(`count`)

Read a specific amount of samples from the file.

#### WaveFile.read_sample()

Read only one sample from the file.

#### Write:

**TODO**

#### WaveFile.close()

Close the file and free all associated resources.

### Metadata Methods:

#### WaveFile.total_samples()

Get total number of audio samples in the file.

#### WaveFile.duration()

Get total duration of the audio file.

#### WaveFile.data_len()

Get the total length of sample bytes in the file.

#### WaveFile.bytes_per_sample()

Get total bytes per each sample.

#### WaveFile.sample_rate()

Get the sample rate (samples per second).

#### WaveFile.sample_size()

Get the size of one sample()

#### WaveFile.format()

Get the format of the WAV audio. Either `PCM`, `IEEE`, `ALAW`,`MULAW` or `EXTENSIBLE`.

#### WaveFile.num_channels()

Get the total number of channels in the audio stream.

#### WaveFile.valid_bits_per_sample()

Get the bits per each sample.

## Supported Formats:

Currently only the following formats are supported:

1. PCM

2. IEEE

3. ALAW

4. MULAW

5. EXTENSIBLE
